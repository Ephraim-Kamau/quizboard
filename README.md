## Description of the Triangle Tracker program
<p> I built a website containing a program called QUIZ BOARD to help my high school after-school computer club. This club was finishing a course on JavaScript and the students had to take a test before completing the course. This will help them to gauge their skills by evaluating them and giving them a score at the ed of the
test.</p>
